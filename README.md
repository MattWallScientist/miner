# miner
mechanistic inference of node-edge relationships

A template with instructions and code for performing a miner analysis is provided in the miner/src directory. 

The template can be opened using Anaconda by selecting jupyter notebook, or by simply typing "jupyter notebook" into the command line. 

Before the miner analysis can be performed, the gene expression data to be analyzed must be added to the miner/data directory with the filename "expressionData.csv".

If survival analysis is desired, a survival file with the name "survival.csv" must added to the miner/data directory
